    "title": "Mermaid diagram code blocks",
    "content": "New (v0.4.0) . Mermaid allows you to add diagrams and visualizations using Markdown code blocks. It is disabled by default. However, you can turn on support for mermaid by adding a mermaid key to your _config.yml. The minimum configuration requires a version key (matching a version in jsDelivr): . mermaid: # Version of mermaid library # Pick an available version from https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/mermaid/ version: \"9.1.3\" . Additional configuration options are loaded through _includes/mermaid_config.js. By default, the contents of the file are the empty object: . // _includes/mermaid_config.js {} . This loads the default settings. The contents of this object should follow mermaid’s configuration API. For example, to override the theme, change _includes/mermaid_config.js to: . // _includes/mermaid_config.js { theme: \"forest\" } . Once mermaid is installed, it can be used in markdown files. The markdown for a simple flowchart example might look like the following: . ```mermaid graph TD; A--&gt;B; A--&gt;C; B--&gt;D; C--&gt;D; ``` . which renders: . graph TD; A--&gt;B; A--&gt;C; B--&gt;D; C--&gt;D; . Note: for demonstration purposes, we’ve enabled mermaid on this site. It is still disabled by default, and users need to opt-in to use it. Using a local mermaid library . To load a local version of mermaid, also use the path key to specify the location of the library; e.g. mermaid: version: \"10.1.0\" # for (v10+) path: \"/assets/js/mermaid.esm.min.mjs\" # for (&lt;v10): # path: \"/assets/js/mermaid.min.js\" # Note: copy both `mermaid.esm.min.mjs` (v10+) or `mermaid.min.js` (&lt;v10) and the associated # `.map` file from the specified version of `mermaid/dist` to `/assets/js/`. For mermaid versions &gt;=10, this file is imported directly as an ESM module (rather than as a plain &lt;script&gt; tag); users should use the mermaid.esm.min.mjs file. In contrast, for mermaid versions &lt;10, this file is loaded as a script tag; it should be a standalone CJS file (i.e. mermaid.min.js). Mermaid versions 10.0 - 10.1 (and possibly, future releases) still encode relative imports in mermaid.esm.min.mjs. Local users must copy all of the contents of the dist folder to the specified path (preserving the relative location of the files). Just the Docs is actively monitoring mermaid releases; an upstream fix is planned. Using mermaid with AsciiDoc . Users of AsciiDoc (e.g. via jekyll-asciidoc) may need additional configuration to use mermaid. By default, AsciiDoc generates HTML markup that mermaid cannot properly parse. The simplest way to resolve this is to use a passthrough block: . ++++ &lt;pre class=\"language-mermaid\"&gt; graph TD; A--&gt;B; A--&gt;C; B--&gt;D; C--&gt;D; &lt;/pre&gt; ++++ . Alternatively, community member @flyx has contributed a Ruby extension that does not require extra markup. The extension is available as a GitHub Gist. Thank you to @flyx! . The asciidoctor-diagram extension which also supports mermaid is not recommended for use with Just the Docs, since it requires separate configuration e.g. for theming, and is known to not be trivial to set up.

    "content": "Scientia potentia est (knowledge is power) . Hi , Thank you all for joining the community! . I wanted to share the story behind why we started this and what drives us. I recently moved to Lucknow and wanted to connect with fellow developers, open-source enthusiasts, and hackers. However, I found that Lucknow lacks such a technology culture and community. I remember wishing as a college student that I had a mentor to guide me and clarify my doubts. I want the next generation to have those opportunities. So I spoke with friends from Lucknow who now work at various companies and agreed to give back by mentoring youth interested in AI &amp; ML. With that goal, We founded Lucknow AI to advance AI literacy and skills through collaborative workshops, meetups, paper discussions, and community growth. I am Aaditya (Ankit), a senior research engineer at Saama AI Research Lab with over 6+ years in core AI research. I love hacking things together, building open-source tools, and publishing state-of-the-art research. You can find more about my background &amp; research at aadityaura.github.io . You might be surprised to know that no one in the Lucknow AI community is paid or sponsored. We are just a group of coding geeks and hackers who are passionate about growing the local AI ecosystem! . We nurture Lucknow AI like our own child, volunteering time outside work or college to support the community. Seniors mentor newcomers not due to any obligation but out of a genuine desire to uplift. We contribute open-source code, curate datasets, brainstorm ideas, analyze research papers and more in the quest to push the boundaries of what AI can achieve. And we do it together as one unstoppable, collaborative force! . This is a safe space where you can learn, teach, create, and grow. Imagine the breakthrough innovations we can create when we come together as a supportive, tight-knit community! Let’s put Lucknow on the map in AI and have fun along the way. If you share this vision, then you have found your tribe. Welcome home! . Excited for the days ahead, ~ Lucknow AI . ",

When using Kramdown code fences, line numbers are turned on globally by the following configuration option: . kramdown: syntax_highlighter_opts: block: line_numbers: true .
