    "content": "We’re so excited to release Just the Docs v0.4.0. This release has been almost a year in the making - after our new maintenance team has taken over the project, we’ve added two years of backlogged features and bugfixes to modernize the theme. This CHANGELOG will summarize some of the key changes, discuss migrations strategies, and outline broad future plans for this theme. Brief Overview - Highlighted Changes . v0.4.0 contains many new features and bugfixes. We enumerate all of them in further sections in this changelog; however, we’d like to call out some of the most-requested changes: . | better support for dark theme: dark highlighting, search input color | callouts, a new design component to highlight content | configuring mermaid.js, a markdown-native diagram visualization library | copy code button for code snippets | external navigation links | major improvements to nav generation efficiency and robustness | minor improvements to built-in accessibility (SVG icons, nav titles, skip to main content) | modularized site components (advanced feature) | new custom includes: table of contents heading, navigation panel footer, search placeholder, lunr search indices | bugfixes involving WEBrick and Ruby 3, Liquid processing in CSS comments, nested task lists, relative URLs, scroll navigation, corrupted search data from rake, breadcrumbs, and more! | more documentation for custom includes, this changelog, and the migration guide | . After usage instructions and the roadmap, we enumerate all changes from v0.3.3. Using Release v0.4.0 . Unlike pre-releases, v0.4.0 is a new semver minor release for the theme. That means that users who have not pinned the theme version will be automatically upgraded to v0.4.0 the next time they build their site. To use this release explicitly as a remote theme: . remote_theme: just-the-docs/just-the-docs@v0.4.0 . To use this RC explicitly as a gem-based theme, pin the version in your Gemfile and re-run bundle install or bundle update just-the-docs: . gem \"just-the-docs\", \"0.4.0\" . If you would prefer to not upgrade, you can enforce that explicitly: . | pin your gem version in your Gemfile, like so gem \"just-the-docs\", \"0.3.3\" . | freeze the remote_theme, like so remote_theme: just-the-docs/just-the-docs@v0.3.3 . | . Migration Guide and Strategies . We’ve developed a new migration guide for users to migrate from version v0.3.3 to v0.4.0. It outlines major changes in project maintenance (e.g. new repository link, team) as well as breaking changes that may break your site (and potential solutions). We suggest that all users refer to the guide before manually upgrading their site. For the vast majority of users, we do not anticipate that this will be a breaking change. The major touch points are surrounding new includes, navigation (ordering, pages, and collections), the favicon, and a shift to relative URLs. However, users who heavily customize the theme (primarily by overriding includes) will likely have to make minor changes. Given the length of features added in this release, users may want to incrementally upgrade through the pre-releases. To follow this approach, read this changelog from v0.4.0.rc1 to v0.4.0.rc5; this breaks down the release into small chunks, each of which should be easier to upgrade. v0.4.0.rc5 is identical to this release. For support with migrating to v0.4.0, open an issue or start a discussion and let us know! . Roadmap (What’s Next?) . Moving forward, we plan to release more frequently with smaller, bite-sized changes. This should make it easier for users to upgrade in the future! . Broadly, many features are still on the radar. We anticipate the rest of v0.4.x to be bugfixes surrounding this new release. For version v0.5, our roadmap includes: . | a theme toggle (light/dark mode), with automatic theme switching based on browser preferences | better GDPR compliance for analytics | multi-level/recursive navigation (unlimited hierarchy of child pages) | . In future versions, we also plan on: . | adding better dark theme defaults | adding better internationalization support | exploring offline PDF generation | improving accessibility within the theme | improving search functionality | refactoring and improving the robustness of our codebase | . Have ideas for what’s next, or want to get involved? Open an issue or start a discussion and let us know! We’re looking for more contributors and maintainers to help us develop the theme.

Big ones include fixing the rake command, using relative_url, and search input color | More documentation, especially on using custom includes | Updating core dependencies to stable Ruby versions | A WIP template repository that allows you to setup your own repository using Just the Docs and GitHub Pages with one click - give it a shot! More documentation, etc. is on the way! | . We want your feedback! Are these changes helpful? Are our docs easy to understand? Should new features like mermaid be opt-in or opt-out?

We’re very thankful for the work that he’s done to create and maintain one of the most popular Jekyll themes. Please join us in giving him thanks! . The new core team currently consists of @mattxwang, @pdmosses, @skullface, @dougaitken, and @max06. Over the past six months, we’ve been triaging and merging in PRs, as well as contributing our own fixes. We’ll continue to address open issues, merge in PRs from the community, and plan out the future of Just the Docs. If you’d like to contribute, now is a great time! . Roadmap . In the short-term, we’re committed to tidying up everything for a v0.4.0 release. This involves fixing bugs reported from the community in this pre-release, as well as continually merging in minor PRs. We’re also scoping out medium and long-term projects, and want to keep you in the loop.

    "title": "v0.5.x - v0.6.0",
    "content": "POTENTIALLY-BREAKING CHANGES in v0.6.0 . There are some very minor potentially-breaking changes for users in version v0.6.0. They do not affect the vast majority of users; however, this may affect users of (undocumented) internal theme structure. They concern: . | the addition of new _includes/favicon.html, _includes/head_nav.html, and _includes/css/activation.scss.liquid . | explicit migration only necessary if users have defined a custom file with the same name | . | removing id=\"main-content-wrap from wrapper div elements in default layouts . | explicit migration only necessary if users have written code that depends on #main-content-wrap | . | loading the new $color-scheme variable (from the light scheme by default) . | explicit migration only necessary if users have overridden the base light theme | . | caching the favicon for the entire site . | explicit migration only necessary if users have different favicons for different pages | . | . New Includes . Version v0.6.0 introduces three new _includes files: . | _includes/favicon.html, which now contains logic previously in _includes/head.html: loading favicon.ico if no favicon is specified | _includes/head_nav.html, which generates CSS used for the new efficient navigation implementation | _includes/css/activation.scss.liquid, which is used by head_nav for navigation implementation | . If users have existing _includes files with this name, they should be renamed (and imported with their new name) prior to upgrading to 0.6.0. No other change is necessary. Removed #main-content-wrap . In _layouts/default.html and _layouts/minimal.html, the id=\"main-content-wrap\" has been removed from the wrapper div (in part due to a bug with multiple ids on one element). Internally, our theme does not use these ids; for most users, this does not require any action. However, code that relies on this id must be changed. Each of the related elements still has the unique class .main-content-wrap, and can be selected with this class. For example, in CSS: . /* OLD */ #main-content-wrap { /* ... */ } /* NEW */ .main-content-wrap { /* ... */ } . Or in JS: . // OLD document.getElementById(\"main-content-wrap\"); // NEW document.getElementsByClassName(\"main-content-wrap\")[0]; . New $color-scheme variable . The theme now properly sets the color-scheme property. To do so, the new $color-scheme SCSS variable has been created. The variable has been added to the default light scheme, which is always loaded by Just the Docs. Migration is only needed if: . | the packaged light scheme has been overridden (this is not the same as using a custom scheme) | or, the scheme logic to always load light has been changed | . (neither of these behaviours are recommended by Just the Docs) . In either of these cases, users should add a $color-scheme SCSS variable to their active scheme with the appropriate value (see: MDN docs on color-scheme). $color-scheme: light !default; . Cached favicon . Version v0.6.0 adds a new _include that caches the favicon for the entire site. This significantly improves page build times for large sites. However, some users may load different favicons for each page (and/or dynamically change the first favicon load). In this case, they should override the logic in _includes/favicon.html by replacing it with an empty file (this is different from deleting it). No further migration is necessary. ",

    "content": "REPOSITORY CHANGES . Just the Docs . The theme repo is now at https://github.com/just-the-docs/just-the-docs. The name of its default branch is now main. The theme docs website is now published at https://just-the-docs.github.io/just-the-docs. We’ve also retroactively published the theme docs website for version v0.3.3 at https://v0-3-3-docs.just-the-docs.com/. GitHub provides access to previous versions of the theme repo. You can browse previous versions of the theme docs website on the Internet Archive. The README page on the theme repo repeats much of the information from the home page, formatted for browsing on GitHub. It also explains how to install the theme as a Ruby Gem, without creating a new site. Deploy previews . When a PR builds successfully, Netlify provides a preview of how the theme docs website will look if the PR is merged. You can find links to the preview near the bottom of the Conversation tab of the PR. Just the Docs Template . The template at https://github.com/just-the-docs/just-the-docs-template creates a repo with the minimal source files for a Just the Docs website. After configuring the relevant parameters, you can build and serve the website both locally and on GitHub Pages – using either Jekyll 3 or Jekyll 4! . Just the Docs Tests . The tests website at https://just-the-docs.github.io/just-the-docs-tests consists mainly of regression tests for bug fixes and new features. The test source files at https://github.com/just-the-docs/just-the-docs-tests illustrate the use of many Markdown and Jekyll features, including some that are not included in the theme docs. For example, see how to add support for rendering TeX/LaTeX math formulas with KaTeX and MathJax. POTENTIALLY-BREAKING CHANGES in v0.4.0 . If switching to a new release of the theme breaks your website, check that you don’t have any files in the _includes, _layouts, and _sass directories with the same names as files provided by the theme. If your repo has a customised copy of _layouts/default.html from a previous release, try removing it, or replace it by a fresh copy of the theme file. The following changes made in v0.4.0 might break or adversely affect your website when you next rebuild it, unless you have pinned it! . New includes and SCSS . Version 0.4.0 introduces many new _includes files. If you already have an existing include with the same name as a new addition, you will need to migrate or update that include. The new files are (relative to the _includes folder): . | mermaid_config.js | nav_footer_custom | search_placeholder_custom | toc_heading_custom | the entire components/ folder: . | aux_nav, breadcrumbs, children_nav, footer, header, mermaid, search_footer, search_header, sidebar | . | the entire icons/ folder . | code_copy, document, expand, external_link, icons, link, menu, search | . | the entire lunr/ folder . | custom-data.json, custom-index.js | . | . We have removed some code in _sass/vendor and added a new file at _sass/custom/setup.scss. favicons . The file _includes/favicon.html is now ignored by the theme. If you’re using it, your website’s favicon is no longer displayed by browsers. To fix: Move the content of _includes/favicon.html to _includes/head_custom.html. Custom callout colors . The file _sass/custom/custom.scss is now imported last: after the configuration of callouts. If you’ve defined custom color variables for callouts in _sass/custom/custom.scss (and used them when configuring your callouts in _config.yml) you will not be able to rebuild your website. To fix: Move custom color variables for callouts in _sass/custom/custom.scss to _sass/custom/variables.scss. Pages and collections . Links to ordinary pages now appear in the navigation on sites that use collections. You might want the navigation of your site to consist entirely of collections. To fix: Add the front matter nav_exclude: true to pages that the navigation should not display. Relative URLs . All generated URLs are now relative. This is a bug fix, and unlikely to break any site. Relative links to pages within a website support deployment to different servers. Navigation order . The order in which the navigation panel lists pages has been simplified. All pages with nav_order values now come before all pages that are ordered by title. If your website has a group of sibling pages where some siblings have nav_order string values, and others are ordered by numerical title values, the former now come before the latter. To fix: Add numerical nav_order values to the pages with numerical title values. DEPRECATIONS . The following features are deprecated, and to be removed in a future release. Jekyll 3 . You can still use Jekyll 3 (3.8.5 or later) to build websites using v0.4.0 of the theme. However, future releases of the theme may require the use of Jekyll 4. You can already use Jekyll 4 to build your website locally. It should look exactly the same as when built with Jekyll 3.1 . To use Jekyll 4 when building your website on GitHub Pages, you need to run GitHub Actions. The simplest way of setting that up in a new repo is to create the repo using the Just the Docs template. To start running Jekyll 4 to build an existing repo on GitHub Pages, you can create a new repo with the template, then copy its .github/workflows directory, and update your repo settings to use Actions. Footer content configuration . Currently, if your configuration sets footer_content to some text, the theme displays that text at the bottom of the main section of each page. The file _includes/footer_custom.html provides a more general way of customizing not only the text but also the markup for the page footer area. You can replicate the current display of TEXT in the footer using the following markup: . &lt;p class=\"text-small text-grey-dk-100 mb-0\"&gt;TEXT&lt;/p&gt; . THEME WEBSITE CHANGES . The website now uses callouts2 to draw attention to important information. The theme uses semantic versioning. A normal version number takes the form X.Y.Z, where X is the major version, Y is the minor version, and Z is the patch version. The theme uses version X.Y.Z.rcN for pre-release N of version X.Y.Z. When referring to version numbers on GitHub, we usually prefix them by ‘v’. Major version zero (0.Y.Z) is for initial development, where anything may change at any time. In practice, we increment the patch version Z for bug fixes and backwards compatible changes; we increment the minor version Y for changes that could break websites using the theme without pinning it to a specific version. The label NEW in the theme website indicates a feature that has been changed or added since the release of the previous minor version. For example, after the release of v0.4.Z, the theme website should label NEW all features that we have changed or added since v0.3.0 – not just since v0.3.3. When we release v0.5.0, we will remove all those labels, and add labels on features since v0.4.0. The theme docs website is not itself versioned. It changes incrementally, independently of theme releases. Home page . The theme home page now focuses on the simplest ways of using the theme. It also notes the different behaviour of theme and remote_theme in connection with interim versions of the theme, such as pre-releases. CHANGELOG . The CHANGELOG page lists the changes made in all previous releases and pre-releases of new versions of the theme gem. It also lists changes made to the main branch of the theme since the latest release or pre-release. For changes since v0.3.3, the log usually references the merged PR that made the change and its author. NON-BREAKING CHANGES (OUTLINE ONLY) . Accessibility . | Skip to main content: the first keyboard-navigatable item is now a link to skip over the sidebar and header to the main content of the page. PR: #949. | Aria-labels: improved aria-labels have been added to various site elements.

PR: #1135 | . Custom Includes . We’ve added several custom _includes to provide users with more customization options for different site elements. We’ve also added a section to Configuration to outline these. All of these are opt-in by default; however, these may be breaking if you have existing _includes with the same name. Each item is listed with the relevant file and PR. | TOC heading: toc_heading_custom.html, PR: #980 | Navigation panel footer: nav_footer_custom.html, PR: #474 | Search placeholder: search_placeholder_custom.html, PR: #613 | Modular site components: components/ and icons/, PR: [#1058] | Custom search indices: lunr/, PR: #1068 | . In a future (version 1) release, we may rename the custom include files. Modular Components . We’ve broken up the default layout (_layouts/default.html) into multiple reusable components.

    "title": "Mermaid diagram code blocks",
    "content": "New (v0.4.0) . Mermaid allows you to add diagrams and visualizations using Markdown code blocks. It is disabled by default. However, you can turn on support for mermaid by adding a mermaid key to your _config.yml. The minimum configuration requires a version key (matching a version in jsDelivr): . mermaid: # Version of mermaid library # Pick an available version from https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/mermaid/ version: \"9.1.3\" . Additional configuration options are loaded through _includes/mermaid_config.js. By default, the contents of the file are the empty object: . // _includes/mermaid_config.js {} . This loads the default settings. The contents of this object should follow mermaid’s configuration API. For example, to override the theme, change _includes/mermaid_config.js to: . // _includes/mermaid_config.js { theme: \"forest\" } . Once mermaid is installed, it can be used in markdown files. The markdown for a simple flowchart example might look like the following: . ```mermaid graph TD; A--&gt;B; A--&gt;C; B--&gt;D; C--&gt;D; ``` . which renders: . graph TD; A--&gt;B; A--&gt;C; B--&gt;D; C--&gt;D; . Note: for demonstration purposes, we’ve enabled mermaid on this site. It is still disabled by default, and users need to opt-in to use it. Using a local mermaid library . To load a local version of mermaid, also use the path key to specify the location of the library; e.g. mermaid: version: \"10.1.0\" # for (v10+) path: \"/assets/js/mermaid.esm.min.mjs\" # for (&lt;v10): # path: \"/assets/js/mermaid.min.js\" # Note: copy both `mermaid.esm.min.mjs` (v10+) or `mermaid.min.js` (&lt;v10) and the associated # `.map` file from the specified version of `mermaid/dist` to `/assets/js/`. For mermaid versions &gt;=10, this file is imported directly as an ESM module (rather than as a plain &lt;script&gt; tag); users should use the mermaid.esm.min.mjs file. In contrast, for mermaid versions &lt;10, this file is loaded as a script tag; it should be a standalone CJS file (i.e. mermaid.min.js). Mermaid versions 10.0 - 10.1 (and possibly, future releases) still encode relative imports in mermaid.esm.min.mjs. Local users must copy all of the contents of the dist folder to the specified path (preserving the relative location of the files). Just the Docs is actively monitoring mermaid releases; an upstream fix is planned. Using mermaid with AsciiDoc . Users of AsciiDoc (e.g. via jekyll-asciidoc) may need additional configuration to use mermaid. By default, AsciiDoc generates HTML markup that mermaid cannot properly parse. The simplest way to resolve this is to use a passthrough block: . ++++ &lt;pre class=\"language-mermaid\"&gt; graph TD; A--&gt;B; A--&gt;C; B--&gt;D; C--&gt;D; &lt;/pre&gt; ++++ . Alternatively, community member @flyx has contributed a Ruby extension that does not require extra markup. The extension is available as a GitHub Gist. Thank you to @flyx! . The asciidoctor-diagram extension which also supports mermaid is not recommended for use with Just the Docs, since it requires separate configuration e.g. for theming, and is known to not be trivial to set up.

If you want to add a scheme named foo (can be any name) just add a file _sass/color_schemes/foo.scss (replace foo by your scheme name) where you override theme variables to change colors, fonts, spacing, etc. Since the default color scheme is light, your custom scheme is implicitly based on the variable settings used by the light scheme. If you want your custom scheme to be based on the dark scheme, you need to start your file with the following line: . @import \"./color_schemes/dark\"; . You can define custom schemes based on other custom schemes in the same way. Available variables are listed in the _variables.scss file. For example, to change the link color from the purple default to blue, include the following inside your scheme file: . Example . $link-color: $blue-000; . Keep in mind that changing a variable will not automatically change the value of other variables that depend on it. For example, the default link color ($link-color) is set to $purple-000. However, redefining $purple-000 in a custom color scheme will not automatically change $link-color to match it. Instead, each variable that relies on previously-cascaded values must be manually reimplemented by copying the dependent rules from _variables.scss — in this case, rewriting $link-color: $purple-000;. Note: Editing the variables directly in _sass/support/variables.scss is not recommended and can cause other dependencies to fail. Please use scheme files. Use a custom scheme . To use the custom color scheme, only set the color_scheme parameter in your site’s _config.yml file: . color_scheme: foo . Switchable custom scheme . If you want to be able to change the scheme dynamically, for example via javascript, just add a file assets/css/just-the-docs-foo.scss (replace foo by your scheme name) with the following content: . --- --- {% include css/just-the-docs.scss.liquid color_scheme=\"foo\" %} .

New (v0.4.0) . _includes/toc_heading_custom.html . If the page has any child pages, and has_toc is not set to false, this content appears as a heading above the auto-generating list of child pages after the page’s content. Example . To change the default TOC heading to “Contents”, create _includes/toc_heading_custom.html and add: . &lt;h2 class=\"text-delta\"&gt;Contents&lt;/h2&gt; . The (optional) text-delta class makes the heading appear as Contents . Custom Footer . _includes/footer_custom.html . This content appears at the bottom of every page’s main content. More info for this include can be found in the Configuration - Footer content. Custom Head . _includes/head_custom.html . Any HTML added to this file will be inserted before the closing &lt;head&gt; tag. This might include additional &lt;meta&gt;, &lt;link&gt;, or &lt;script&gt; tags. The &lt;head&gt; tag automatically includes a link to an existing favicon if you set favicon_ico to the corresponding path in your configuration, or if the path to the favicon is /favicon.ico. Custom Header . _includes/header_custom.html . Content added to this file appears at the top of every page’s main content between the site search and auxiliary links if they are enabled. If search_enabled were set to false and aux_links were removed, the content of header_custom.html would occupy the space at the top of every page. Custom Nav Footer .

    "title": "Custom layouts and includes",
    "content": "New (v0.4.0) . Advanced . Just the Docs uses Jekyll’s powerful layouts and includes features to generate and compose various elements of the site. Jekyll users and developers can extend or replace existing layouts and includes to customize the entire site layout. Default layout and includable components . The default layout is inherited by most of the “out-of-the-box” pages provided by Just the Docs. It composes various re-usable components of the site, including the sidebar, navbar, footer, breadcrumbs, and various imports. Most users who create new pages or layouts will inherit from default. Here is a simplified code example of what it looks like: . &lt;!-- a simplified version of _layouts/default.html --&gt; &lt;html&gt; {% include head.html %} &lt;body&gt; {% include icons/icons.html %} {% include components/sidebar.html %} {% include components/header.html %} {% include components/breadcrumbs.html %} {% if site.heading_anchors != false %} {% include vendor/anchor_headings.html html=content ... %} {% else %} {{ content }} {% endif %} {% if page.has_children == true and page.has_toc != false %} {% include components/children_nav.html %} {% endif %} {% include components/footer.html %} {% if site.search_enabled != false %} {% include components/search_footer.html %} {% endif %} {% if site.mermaid %} {% include components/mermaid.html %} {% endif %} &lt;/body&gt; &lt;/html&gt; . Component summary . Defining a new _includes with the same name as any of these components will significantly change the existing layout. Please proceed with caution when adjusting them. To briefly summarize each component: . | _includes/head.html is the entire &lt;head&gt; tag for the site; this imports stylesheets, various JavaScript files (ex: analytics, mermaid, search, and Just the Docs code), and SEO / meta information. | _includes/icons/icons.html imports all SVG icons that are used throughout the site. Some, such as those relating to search or code snippet copying, are only loaded when those features are enabled. | _includes/components/sidebar.html renders the sidebar, containing the site header, navigation links, external links, collections, and nav footer. | _includes/components/header.html renders the navigation header, containing the search bar, custom header, and aux links | _includes/components/breadcrumbs.html renders the breadcrumbs feature | vendor/anchor_headings.html is a local copy of Vladimir Jimenez’s jekyll-anchor-headings snippet | _includes/components/children_nav.html renders a list of nav links to child pages on parent pages | _includes/components/footer.html renders the bottom-of-page footer | _includes/components/search_footer.html renders DOM elements that are necessary for the search bar to work | _includes/components/mermaid.html initializes mermaid if the feature is enabled | . Each of these components can be overridden individually using the same process described in the Override includes section. In particular, the granularity of components should allow users to replace certain components (such as the sidebar) without having to adjust the rest of the code. Future versions may subdivide components further; we guarantee that we will only place them in folders (ex components/, icons/, or a new js/) to avoid top-level namespace collisions. Alternative layouts and example (minimal) . Users can develop custom layouts that compose, omit, or add components differently. We provide one first-class example titled minimal, inspired by Kevin Lin’s work in just-the-class. This minimal layout does not render the sidebar, header, or search. To see an example, visit the minimal layout test page. Here is a simplified code example of what it looks like: . &lt;!-- a simplified version of _layouts/minimal.html --&gt; &lt;html&gt; {% include head.html %} &lt;body&gt; {% include icons/icons.html %} {% comment %} Bandaid fix for breadcrumbs here! {% endcomment %} {% include components/breadcrumbs.html %} {% if site.heading_anchors != false %} {% include vendor/anchor_headings.html html=content ... %} {% else %} {{ content }} {% endif %} {% if page.has_children == true and page.has_toc != false %} {% include components/children_nav.html %} {% endif %} {% include components/footer.html %} {% if site.mermaid %} {% include components/mermaid.html %} {% endif %} &lt;/body&gt; &lt;/html&gt; . This layout is packaged in Just the Docs. Users can indicate this alternative layout in page front matter: . --- layout: minimal title: Minimal layout test --- . Similarly, users and developers can create other alternative layouts using Just the Docs’ reusable includable components. Default layout and inheritance chain . Under the hood, . | default and minimal inherit from the table_wrappers layout, which wraps all HTML &lt;table&gt; tags with a div .table-wrapper | table_wrappers inherits from vendor/compress, which is a local copy of Anatol Broder’s jekyll-compress-html Jekyll plugin | . Note that as of now, minimal and default have no inheritance relationship. Overridden default Jekyll layouts . By default, Jekyll (and its default theme minima) provide the about, home, page, and post layouts. In Just the Docs, we override all of these layouts with the default layout. Each of those layouts is simply: . --- layout: default --- {{ content }} . ",

First, it is recommended that you keep pages that are related in a directory together… For example, in these docs, we keep all of the written documentation in the ./docs directory and each of the sections in subdirectories like ./docs/ui-components and ./docs/utilities. This gives us an organization like: . +-- .. |-- (Jekyll files) |-- docs |-- ui-components | |-- index.md (parent page) | |-- buttons.md | |-- code.md | |-- labels.md | |-- tables.md | +-- typography.md | |-- utilities | |-- index.md (parent page) | |-- color.md | |-- layout.md | |-- responsive-modifiers.md | +-- typography.md | |-- (other md files, pages with no children) | +-- .. |-- (Jekyll files) +-- .. On the parent pages, add this YAML front matter parameter: . | has_children: true (tells us that this is a parent page) | . Example (parent pages) . --- layout: default title: UI Components nav_order: 2 has_children: true --- . Here we’re setting up the UI Components landing page that is available at /docs/ui-components, which has children and is ordered second in the main nav. Child pages . On child pages, simply set the parent: YAML front matter to whatever the parent’s page title is and set a nav order (this number is now scoped within the section). Example (child pages) . --- layout: default title: Buttons parent: UI Components nav_order: 2 --- . The Buttons page appears as a child of UI Components and appears second in the UI Components section. Ordering child pages . New (v0.4.0) . You can optionally add the following to the YAML front matter to reverse the default sort order of child pages: . | child_nav_order: reversed | . Example (ordering child pages) . --- layout: default title: Reversed Child Pages child_nav_order: reversed --- . Auto-generating Table of Contents . By default, all pages with children will automatically append a Table of Contents which lists the child pages after the parent page’s content. To disable this auto Table of Contents, set has_toc: false in the parent page’s YAML front matter.
